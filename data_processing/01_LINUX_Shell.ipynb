    "* **directory**: For Windows users, the word \"directory\" may not be familiar. It is similar to \"folder\".\n",
    "* **terminal**: Decades ago, there was no \"monitor\" like today. Terminal was used as a tunnel between the computer or calculator and human (thus \"terminal\". In other words, it displays things from computer to people OR gets input from person to computer. Nowadays, terminal means a program which does similar job, but with much powerful functionalities.\n",
    "* **shell**: Shell is an application running on terminal, and it interprets what people type to the terminal. Thus it is also called \"command line interpreter\". `bash` is one of such shells. \n",
    "* **prompt**: A serial of characters which indicates that the terminal is ready to get command from you. It's `$` on Ubuntu and `>>>` for Python.\n",
    "* `ls`: \"List\"\n",
    "* `cd`: \"Change Directory\"\n",
    "* `cp`: \"Copy\"\n",
    "* `mv`: \"Move\"\n",
    "* `mkdir`: \"Make Directory\"\n",
    "* `pwd`: \"Present Working Directory\", i.e., your present location\n",
    "* `chmod`: \"Change Mode\"\n",
    "* `rm`: \"Remove\"\n",
    "* `~`: The home directory. Type `cd ~` and then `pwd` to see what `~` means.\n",
