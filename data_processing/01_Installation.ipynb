There are reasons for these transformations, and you may be able to find the reasons as time goes, if you are interested.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "astropy.test(package='io.fits')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While the test is going on, look at the names of the directories, like `astropy/table`, `astropy/units`, etc. These are the names we will encounter very frequently, so this test is not only to **test**, but also to get accustomed to the astropy and python language.\n",

    "Some tests are known to fail when run from the IPython prompt; especially, but not limited to tests involving logging and warning handling.  Unless you are certain as to the cause of the failure, please check that the failure occurs outside IPython as well.  See http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/known_issues.html#failing-logging-tests-when-running-the-tests-in-ipython for more information.\n",

    "## 4. Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are bunch of different editors (including IDEs = Integrated Development Environment) to edit the codes. I personally use spyder (it is installed from Anaconda by default, and you can use it by double-click the spyder app icon or type `spyder &` on the terminal). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some may prefer **Wing** IDE, which is widely being used in educational institutions, or **PyDev**, **PyCharm**, and even **VI** or **Emacs**. VI is quite powerful since it is accessible for virtually all of the computers around the world by default, and the debugger, gdb, is also accessible on terminal. If you have an IDE, it most likely contain its own fancy debugger, too. For Windows computers, **Visual Studio** is also a good choice. For Ubuntu, **gedit** or **geany** are also attractable choices. **Atom** is also a fancy editor. I use geany for miscellaneous and short works because it is extremely light, and Atom for coding C language-based programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have tried all the aforementioned editors, and settled down to the lightest, fastest, most intuitive/interactive, and yet functional editors after ~ 1 year of trial and error. BUT this is just my personal opinion, and you may find very different solution. I have many friends who use VI only for all the coding works. If you can, I recommend to use VI as your main editor, and at least learn how to use it. I don't use VI just because for me it is too difficult to use it.\n",

There is a *historical standard*, which is kind of an *affiliated package of IRAF*, [SAO ds9](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html). The most recent version as of Feb 2017 is ver 7.5. Some people use [Maxim DL](http://diffractionlimited.com/product/maxim-dl/), but it's commercial and used mostly by amateur astronomers. In the future, as Python gets more and more intention, Ginga will be another powerful option. We are not sure when Ginga will become quite *perfect*, but until then, I recommend you to use both of them. Their pros and cons will be explained from now.\n",

    "[Ginga](https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (pronounced *ging-ga*, which means galaxy in Japanese; the reason for the name is explained in the link) is an affiliated package of astropy, and is used for FITS image viewer.

So Ginga is made to fully funtional with Python only, as well as to be able to interact with IRAF as ds9 does.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `ginga &` on terminal or `ecl> !ginga &` on IRAF console. Although you can do `ginga image.fits &` as you did for ds9, it is usually better to use interactive drag-and-drop way to open image than command line. In Ginga, you can also use `tools -> FBrowser`.\n",

    "Although it is not recommended, you may want to open ds9 or ginga from Python (e.g., iPython or Spyder), than terminal or Windows command prompt.
